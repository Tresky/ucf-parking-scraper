# UCF Parking Garage Scraper

### Execution
`node app.js`

### Description
Very simple Node script that scrapes the public facing garage data from the UCF parking site. The data is freely available for viewing and I am simply parsing the HTML associated with it. The data displayed portrays the total number of parking slots that are full in comparison with the total amount of parking spots available. Thus, the data gives an estimation of how full each garage around campus is.
